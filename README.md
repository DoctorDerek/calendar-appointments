# ðŸ‘€ View Production Build at https://calendar-appointments.vercel.app

I extended [this](https://github.com/DoctorDerek/calendar-appointments) React-Redux calendar app to include the ability to add and display reminders or appointments.

Additionally, I added 10 other major features, including best practices and 100% test coverage.

Below you will find a complete feature set, description of technologies, and technical journal.

## Required Features

1. ðŸŸ© Added the ability to add new reminders for a user-entered date and time
   - If you click on the green Floating Action Button at the bottom right corner of the screen, an empty dialog will now open. **I used this space to create the Add Reminder user interface**.
2. ðŸŸ© Limited reminders to no more than a maximum of 30 characters.
3. ðŸŸ© Allowed the user to select a color when creating a reminder and display it appropriately.
4. ðŸŸ© Displayed reminders on the calendar view in the correct time order.
   - If you click on a calendar cell, an empty dialog will now appear. I also used this space to display reminders.
5. ðŸŸ© Properly handled overflow when multiple reminders appear on the same date.

## Additional Features

1. âœ… Deployed production build of Next.js 11.0.2@latest with CI/CD
2. âœ… Upgraded React 16.8 to React 17.0.2@latest + refactor components
3. âœ… Upgraded Material UI v3 to v5@latest based on Emotion for CSS-in-JS
4. âœ… Added Tailwind CSS v2.2.4 with [Just-in-Time](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/just-in-time-mode) JIT mode + PostCSS autoprefixer
5. âœ… Established engineering best practices
   - Prettier, ESLint, Husky Git Hooks (for Prettier + ESLint), Editor Config, `.gitattributes`, TypeScript Import Sorter, `tsconfig.json`
6. ðŸŸ© Crafted unit tests for new code feature (TDD / Test Driven Development)
   - Jest + React Testing Library with React Test Renderer
7. âœ… Wrote unit testing to existing code (0% âž¡ 100% test coverage)
8. âœ… Refactored stateful `App.tsx` React.Component to functional component
9. ðŸŸ© Persisted data across sessions using HTML5 Local Storage
10. ðŸŸ© Created mobile design + dark mode toggle + "cookies banner"
